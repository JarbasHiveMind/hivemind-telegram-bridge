# HiveMind Telegram Bridge

This bridges a Telegram bot to a HiveMind node. A HiveMind bridge is a
satellite whose input and output are a chat platform instead of a
microphone: messages sent to the bot become HiveMind utterances, and the
hub's spoken replies are posted back into the same Telegram chat.

## Getting a bot token

Talk to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram, send `/newbot`,
and follow the prompts. BotFather gives you a token that looks like
`123456789:AAExampleTokenDoNotShareThisInAnyForm`. Treat it like a
password: anyone who has it can send messages as your bot. Do not commit
it to a repo or paste it into a public issue.

## Registering the bridge on the hub

Every HiveMind client needs credentials and, separately, permission to
send the message types it uses. On the machine running `hivemind-core`:

```bash
hivemind-core add-client
```

This prints an access key and password; pass them to the bridge as
`--access-key` / `--password` (or store them once with
`hivemind-client set-identity` and omit the flags).

A freshly added client is denied every message type by default. The
bridge needs at least:

```bash
hivemind-core allow-msg recognizer_loop:utterance <client_id>
hivemind-core allow-msg speak <client_id>
```

`<client_id>` is printed by `add-client` (and by `hivemind-core
list-clients` afterwards). Skipping this step is the single most common
reason a bridge "connects fine" but nothing ever seems to happen: the hub
silently drops every message the client sends until it is whitelisted.

## Running the bridge

```bash
pip install .
hivemind-telegram-bridge \
  --token <your-botfather-token> \
  --access-key <key> --password <password> \
  --host ws://127.0.0.1 --port 5678
```

By default the bridge answers any chat it has been added to or that
messages it directly. Pass `--allowed-chat <chat_id>` (repeatable) to
restrict it to specific chats.

Useful flags:

- `--site-id`: this bridge's HiveMind site id. If you run more than one
  bridge (or more than one instance of this bridge) on the same host,
  give each a distinct site id — otherwise they collide over the same
  identity file and pinned peer keys.
- `--self-signed`: accept a self-signed TLS certificate on `wss://` hubs.
- `--lang`: the language tag attached to forwarded utterances (default
  `en-us`).

Run `hivemind-telegram-bridge --help` for the full list.

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t hivemind-telegram-bridge .
docker run --rm \
  -e TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=... \
  -e HIVEMIND_ACCESS_KEY=... \
  -e HIVEMIND_PASSWORD=... \
  -e HIVEMIND_HOST=ws://hivemind-core \
  hivemind-telegram-bridge
```

or via `docker-compose.yml` — copy it, fill in the environment section,
and `docker compose up`.

## What this bridge does, precisely

- Connects to Telegram with `python-telegram-bot`'s async `Application`
  and long-polling; connects to the HiveMind hub with
  `hivemind_bus_client.HiveMessageBusClient`.
- Skips its own messages (so it can never talk to itself) and any
  non-text message.
- Only forwards messages once the HiveMind handshake has completed —
  forwarding earlier would get the connection killed by the hub instead
  of just failing the one message.
- Forwards each remaining message as a `recognizer_loop:utterance` bus
  message, carrying the Telegram chat id and user in the message
  context so the hub's `speak` reply can be routed back to the right
  chat.
- Posts `speak` replies (and a fixed fallback line on
  `hive.complete_intent_failure`) back into the originating chat.

## Testing

```bash
pip install -e .[test]
pytest tests/
```

The test suite mocks both the Telegram `Application` and the HiveMind
`HiveMessageBusClient`, so it runs without a live token or hub. It has
not been exercised against a real Telegram bot or a real HiveMind hub —
that needs an actual bot token, which this repository does not have.
